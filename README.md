        <p>After a bit of a break it was great to be back at the New Inn in Wilsden. A great crowd turned up to see Dave's final public appearance with us as Bass Player, along with a special guest Landlord on drums.</p>

        <p>Following on from our Calais Fundraiser earlier in the year, we felt it was important to raise more money to help send Clowns Without Borders to the refugee camps in France. There, they work hard to distract those in the camps from the appalling conditions around them.</p>
